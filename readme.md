# What It Does #
This project is a solution to the 8-Tile Problem in Artificial Intelligence using two techniques written in Python- Iterative Deepening Depth-First Search (IDS.py) and Iterative Deepening A* (IDAstar.py). Both solutions provide the given outputs at the
  top of the script, and the inputs within the script, but for each of the techniques the same start point was used
   for each question. 

# What I Learned #
It had been a couple years since I had last written in **Python**, so this helped get me used to the language again
. This was the first project I had written using actual **AI** techniques to solve a problem.  

# Usage Notes #
Run each script in console / terminal to verify the output is as expected, the process for each question is printed
 to standard output. A virtual environment running Python v3.9.x is recommended.
